# RPS-Multiplayer

This app is a rock paper scissors game that showcases the use of Firebase's databases. 
<br> With the integration of firebase, we are able to play with another player, as players and moves are logged.

## How the app works

- You enter your user name to join the game
- The user is stored into Firebase's database
- Once a name is entered it will append the name to the appropriate side and the scoreboard
- Once there are two users, the game starts and each user picks an option between rock, paper, and scissors
- The moves are stored into Firebase's database
- It displays the appropriate result and tallies the users scores
- There is also a chat section for the players
